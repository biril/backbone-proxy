Running
-------

In the example folder, `bower install` to get all dependencies. You can serve the application using
your own web server or use Grunt's connect plugin: `npm install` to get dev-dependencies and then
`grunt connect:server:keepalive` to run a local connect server listening on `localhost:3333`.
